The folder "github" contains all R scripts for simulation.
1. "signal_detection_theory_model.R" contains a function used to simulate signal detection data and estimate SDT parameters. This function is called in all simulations.
2. Simulation 1: the file "simulation1_individual" creates Figure 2.
3. Simulation 2: the file "simulation2_group_ribbon_functions" contains functions for ribbon plots. Other files named "simulation2" are used to generate simulation results.
4. Simulation 3: the file "t_test_functions" contains a function for one-sample and two sample t-test. Other files named "simulation3" are used to generate simulation results.
